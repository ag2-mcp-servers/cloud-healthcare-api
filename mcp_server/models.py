For example, `"Comment = great"` returns messages with `great` in the comment field. * A number field value can be written as an integer, a decimal, or an exponential. The valid relational operators for number fields are the equality operator (`=`), along with the less than/greater than operators (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * A date field value must be written in `yyyy-mm-dd` form. Fields with date and time use the RFC3339 time format. Leading zeros are required for one-digit months and days. The valid relational operators for date fields are the equality operator (`=`) , along with the less than/greater than operators (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`). Note that there is no inequality (`!=`) operator. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. * Multiple field query expressions can be combined in one query by adding `AND` or `OR` operators between the expressions. If a boolean operator appears within a quoted string, it is not treated as special, it\'s just another part of the character string to be matched. You can prepend the `NOT` operator to an expression to negate it. Fields/functions available for filtering are: * `message_type`, from the MSH-9.1 field. For example, `NOT message_type = "ADT"`. * `send_date` or `sendDate`, the YYYY-MM-DD date the message was sent in the dataset\'s time_zone, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, `send_date < "2017-01-02"`. * `send_time`, the timestamp when the message was sent, using the RFC3339 time format for comparisons, from the MSH-7 segment. For example, `send_time < "2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00"`. * `create_time`, the timestamp when the message was created in the HL7v2 store. Use the RFC3339 time format for comparisons. For example, `create_time < "2017-01-02T00:00:00-05:00"`. * `send_facility`, the care center that the message came from, from the MSH-4 segment. For example, `send_facility = "ABC"`. * `PatientId(value, type)`, which matches if the message lists a patient having an ID of the given value and type in the PID-2, PID-3, or PID-4 segments. For example, `PatientId("123456", "MRN")`. * `labels.x`, a string value of the label with key `x` as set using the Message.labels map. For example, `labels."priority"="high"`.

When there is no existing table for a given resource type, the server attempts to create one. When a table schema doesn\'t align with the schema config, either because of existing incompatible schema or out of band incompatible modification, the server does not stream in new data. One resolution in this case is to delete the incompatible table and let the server recreate one, though the newly created table only contains data after the table recreation. BigQuery imposes a 1 MB limit on streaming insert row size, therefore any resource mutation that generates more than 1 MB of BigQuery data will not be streamed. Results are written to BigQuery tables according to the parameters in BigQueryDestination.WriteDisposition.

The operation (CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE) that results in the new version is recorded in the meta.tag. The tables contain all historical resource versions since streaming was enabled. For query convenience, the server also creates one view per table of the same name containing only the current resource version. The streamed data in the BigQuery dataset is not guaranteed to be completely unique. The combination of the id and meta.versionId columns should ideally identify a single unique row. But in rare cases, duplicates may exist. At query time, users may use the SQL select statement to keep only one of the duplicate rows given an id and meta.versionId pair.
